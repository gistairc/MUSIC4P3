#  MUSIC for P3 dataset

## Overview
**MU**ltiband **S**atellite **I**magery for object  **C**lassification   (**MUSIC**)  to detect **P**hotovoltaic **P**ower **P**lants 


The number of photovoltaic power plants is growing so rapidly that we must rely on satellitel observations and efficient machine learning methods for the global monitoring. **MUSIC** for P3 (**P**hotovoltaic **P**ower **P**lants) is a  training and validation dataset generated by  [AIRC/AIST](http://www.airc.aist.go.jp/en/) to support such a  global survey of photovoltaic power plants.  


We have picked up the photovoltaic power plants listed on [the website of Electrical Japan](http://agora.ex.nii.ac.jp/earthquake/201103-eastjapan/energy/electrical-japan/type/8.html.ja) only if they generated more than 5MW electricity and the construction had been completed by 2015. The multiband satellite images of these target areas, taken by [Landsat-8](https://landsat.usgs.gov/landsat-8), were cropped into a 16 × 16 grid covering a 480 × 480 meter area as shown below.

These patch images are classified as “positives” if the solar panels cover more than 20% of the total areas, while patches with no solar panels are classified as “negatives”. The rest with the intermediate coverage (0~20%) were neither “positives” and “negatives”. 


You can download the MUSIC for P3 dataset with two different format (HDF5 and GeoTiff) along with the source code for the detection and classification. More detailed exaplanations can be found in the following papers.

It should be noted here that the initial dataset (V1) is contaminated by small-scale plants not included in the original inventory. After publishing these papers, we have checked all the false positives through in-situ survey or high-resolution imagery. In fact, some of "false positives" are found to be relatievely small photovoltaic power plants unlisted in the original database. We produced updated V2 dataset by correcting these misclassification. The performance of our previous works was estimated with  V1 dataset, but more accurate estimate can be achieved by using V2.
